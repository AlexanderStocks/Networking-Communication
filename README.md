# Networking-Communication
Socket is a python module that allows for the writing of TCP/UDP clients, servers and for us to use raw sockets. For the purpose of breaking in or maintaining access to target machines, this module is all that is needed.
I have written some simple clients and servers which are two very common quick network scripts that are written. I wil also create an ssh client/server pair to tunnel traffic using our secure shell.
